Privacy Policy for Clear Closet
Effective Date: January 5, 2026

Last Updated: January 5, 2026

At Clear Closet, we are committed to helping you manage your wardrobe while respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information, particularly given our local-first approach to data.

1. Information We Collect
Because Clear Closet is designed to be local-first, most of your data stays on your device.

Wardrobe Data: Images of clothing, categories, color palettes, fabric textures, and style analysis.

Usage Data: Wear frequency, cost-per-wear calculations, login streaks, and outfit history.

Location Data: If enabled, we use your general location to provide weather-integrated outfit planning.

Device Information: Camera and Gallery access (only used when you choose to add an item).

2. How We Use Your Data
We use the information collected to:

Digitize & Organize: Use AI to automatically tag and categorize your clothing.

Provide Insights: Calculate cost-per-wear and identify neglected items.

Plan Outfits: Match clothes based on weather forecasts and style vibes.

Gamification: Track streaks and provide visual feedback on wardrobe usage.

3. AI Processing & Local-First Philosophy
We prioritize your privacy by processing data locally whenever possible.

On-Device Analysis: Most AI identification (categories, colors, textures) happens directly on your smartphone.

Minimal Data Transfer: If any AI features require cloud processing, images are processed and then discarded; we do not use your personal wardrobe photos to train global AI models without your explicit consent.

4. Third-Party Services
To provide specific features, we may interact with:

Weather APIs: To provide weather-integrated suggestions (your specific coordinates are not stored).

Analytics: We may use anonymized crash reporting tools (like Firebase or Sentry) to improve app stability. These do not contain personal wardrobe images.

5. Data Retention & Deletion
Storage: Since data is stored locally, deleting the app will generally delete all stored wardrobe data unless you have synced it to a personal cloud backup (e.g., iCloud or Google Drive).

User Control: You can edit or delete any item, photo, or history entry within the app at any time.

6. Security
We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However, as the primary data is stored on your device, the security of your information also depends on your device's security settings (passcodes, biometrics).

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our GitHub repository and updating the "Effective Date."
